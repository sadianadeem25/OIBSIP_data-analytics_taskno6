# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the **quality of wine** based on its **chemical attributes**, such as density, acidity, and alcohol content.  
The task involves applying machine learning classifiers to real-world viticulture data and comparing their performance.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Dataset**: [Link to Dataset 1]  
- Contains chemical characteristics of red and white wines along with quality scores.  

---

## ⚙️ Key Concepts & Challenges
1. **Classifier Models** – implemented Random Forest, SGD, and SVC  
2. **Chemical Qualities** – analyzed features such as density, acidity, alcohol content  
3. **Data Analysis Libraries** – Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for computations  
4. **Visualization** – Seaborn & Matplotlib for patterns, correlations, and insights
